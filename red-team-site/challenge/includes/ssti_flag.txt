Congratulations! You successfully exploited the SSTI vulnerability!

The vulnerable code was using eval() on user-controlled input through the ${...} syntax.
This allowed arbitrary PHP code execution on the server.

Common SSTI prevention methods:
1. Never use eval() or similar functions on user input
2. Use established template engines with proper sandboxing (Twig, Blade, etc.)
3. Implement strict input validation
4. Use Content Security Policy headers
