                         CROWN JEWEL - MAXIMUM IMPACT
================================================================================

Congratulations! You have achieved FULL SERVER-SIDE CODE EXECUTION.

This is the highest-impact vulnerability in the system. With this access level,
an attacker could:

  * Read any file on the server (including /etc/passwd, database configs, etc.)
  * Execute arbitrary system commands
  * Pivot to other systems on the network
  * Establish persistent backdoor access
  * Exfiltrate sensitive data

This flag represents the achievement of a PRIMARY RED TEAM OBJECTIVE:
Complete compromise of the target application server.

================================================================================
                              MITIGATION GUIDANCE
================================================================================

1. NEVER use eval() or similar functions on user-controlled input
2. Use established template engines with proper sandboxing (Twig, Blade, etc.)
3. Implement strict input validation and output encoding
4. Deploy Web Application Firewalls (WAF) with SSTI detection rules
5. Principle of Least Privilege - run web apps with minimal permissions
6. Regular security audits and penetration testing
