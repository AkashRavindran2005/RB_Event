# Development notes:
# - Remember to check login_legacy.php for SQL issues
# - api/search.php needs input sanitization
# - Someone reported config.php.bak is still accessible
# - New JWT auth API at api/auth.php - beta testing
# - Newsletter template system needs security review
# - Profile page CSRF protection still TODO
